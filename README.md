# ctx-flow

A token-frugal development framework for Claude Code, shipped as the contents
of a `.claude` folder — this repo *is* the folder; mount it as one.

The premise: **the main thread should hold decisions, and everything else should
hold output.** Build logs, search results, page snapshots and ticket records are
the largest objects in any session and carry the least information per token.
ctx-flow routes each of them into a subagent sized for the job, and keeps
durable memory in [agmem](https://github.com/AlfoldiMate/agmem) — a
per-project MCP memory store — so the main thread's context survives `/clear`
and `/compact`.

## Install

Make this repo your project's `.claude` directory — copy it, or symlink it:

```bash
ln -s /path/to/context-flow /path/to/your-project/.claude
```

For linked git worktrees, symlink the main worktree's `.claude` into each one;
everything here is symlink-safe, and agmem derives its memory space through
the shared git dir regardless, so a fresh worktree is never amnesiac either
way.

Then verify the toolchain:

```
/ctx-flow-doctor
```

### Dependencies

| Tool | Why | Install |
|---|---|---|
| [nu](https://www.nushell.sh) | runs the hooks; provides one of the two MCP servers the framework wants | `brew install nushell` |
| [agmem](https://github.com/AlfoldiMate/agmem) | persistent cross-session memory, over MCP | `brew install AlfoldiMate/tap/agmem` |
| [ast-grep](https://ast-grep.github.io) | structural (syntax-aware) code search | `brew install ast-grep` |
| [gh](https://cli.github.com) | GitHub — always over the GitHub MCP server | `brew install gh` |
| [playwright-cli](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-cli) | browser driving as shell commands | `npm i -g playwright-cli` |
| [rtk](https://github.com/rtk-ai/rtk) | transparently compresses Bash output | `brew install rtk` (hook ships here) |
| acli *(optional)* | Jira | Atlassian's installer |
| tree-sitter-cli *(optional)* | builds grammars ast-grep does not ship | `npm i -g tree-sitter-cli` |

You do not have to *use* Nushell as your shell; the hooks run under `nu`
regardless of what your terminal runs. Register both MCP servers:

```bash
claude mcp add nu -- nu --mcp
claude mcp add --scope user agmem -- agmem
```

**On MCP:** the framework avoids MCP servers — a CLI beats one wherever a CLI
exists (you choose the fields, the output pipes, no schema in the prompt). Two
exceptions, each holding state no CLI reaches: `nu --mcp` earns its slot by
*being* the shell (structured pipelines, `$history` for re-slicing past
results without re-running, safe uncapped first runs), and `agmem` by *being*
the memory — cross-session state that has to outlive every process.

**On agmem:** it needs **v0.1.1 or newer** — older builds have no space
derivation, so every project silently reads and writes one shared `default`
space; no error, just collapsed memory. **v0.1.2+** adds the one-shot
`agmem context`, which upgrades the SessionStart hook from a reminder to
actual briefing injection (v0.1.1 still works; the hook falls back). `agmem --doctor` prints the space it
derives for the current directory, and `/ctx-flow-doctor` flags a stale or
duplicated binary. The store is one directory
(`~/Library/Application Support/dev.agmem.agmem` on macOS,
`~/.local/share/agmem` on Linux) — back it up or delete it as a unit. There is
no server-side LLM: the session distils, the store never rewrites what it
holds.

**On rtk:** the framework's `settings.json` registers its hook (`rtk hook
claude`) — install only the binary, and do **not** also run `rtk init -g`, or
every Bash call is rewritten twice (`/ctx-flow-doctor` flags this as DOUBLED).
As of rtk 0.46 the hook only rewrites the command (`updatedInput`), leaving
your permission prompts intact — older versions also emitted
`permissionDecision: "allow"`. Telemetry is on by default
(`rtk telemetry disable`).

## What's in it

### CLAUDE.md — the system prompt

The routing discipline lives in `CLAUDE.md`, loaded automatically every
session. It used to be a skill; it isn't one any more, deliberately. A skill
must be *discovered* — a description line the model may or may not act on —
and routing that only sometimes applies is routing that silently doesn't.
Rules that apply to every session belong in the file that loads every session.

It carries: the delegation rule (route by **information ratio**, not task
type), the routing table, payload discipline, the memory loop, and the answer
shape — output led by the next action, numbered steps, restated state, no
preamble, questions asked through `AskUserQuestion` rather than prose.

### Five agents

| Agent | Model / effort | Absorbs |
|---|---|---|
| `runner` | haiku / low | builds, suites, linters — returns the failure signature |
| `verifier` | sonnet / high | adversarial check of one claim — defaults to refuting |
| `architect` | opus / high | design of a non-trivial change — read-only, never edits |
| `browser` | sonnet / medium | `playwright-cli` sessions — snapshots stop here |
| `tracker` | haiku / low | Jira/GitHub via `gh`/`acli` — never raw records |

Every one ends with a **mandatory return contract**: fixed keys, hard caps, and
an explicit forbidden list. An unschematized subagent writes an essay; a
schematized one writes 200 tokens. Tiers are picked by *consequence of being
wrong*, not output size — `runner` misses cost one re-dispatch; a bad
`architect` plan is discovered late, after the code exists.

Codebase search is **not** here: Claude Code ships `Explore`, which already
does it. Route search there.

### Four commands

- **`/checkpoint`** — distils the session into agmem claims (recall first, so
  corrections land as `supersedes`) so you can `/clear` instead of letting
  auto-compaction fire; also the gate that accepts or drops agents' proposed
  learnings.
- **`/agmem`** — `show` what the store holds, `tidy` (judge `consolidate`'s
  duplicate/contradiction/stale lists and merge via `supersedes`), or
  `import` a pre-agmem `LEDGER.md`, branch state, and playbooks into the
  store, once.
- **`/ctx-flow-doctor`** — checks every dependency above, the hooks, both MCP
  registrations, and whether ast-grep actually parses this project's
  languages; prints the exact fix for anything broken — including a stale
  agmem binary, which fails silently otherwise.
- **`/ast-grep-it [lang]`** — teaches ast-grep a language it does not ship.
  Called bare, it sets up whatever this project most needs.
  ast-grep loads any tree-sitter grammar from a dynamic library, so "not
  supported" is usually a missing binary, not a missing capability — Nushell
  being the case in point. Finds the grammar repo, compiles it into
  `~/.cache/ctx-flow/grammars` (shared by every project on the machine),
  registers it in the project's `sgconfig.yml`, and verifies it against real
  files. `sgconfig.yml` is machine-local — gitignore it.

### The hooks

Deterministic work that costs zero tokens and happens *every* time, which no
prompt instruction achieves. Three are `.nu` scripts under `hooks/scripts/`;
the fourth is rtk's.

| Event | Does |
|---|---|
| `SessionStart` | injects the memory briefing — `agmem context` (one-shot since agmem 0.1.2) prints the same block the MCP tool assembles, so the hook pushes it into context before the first token, footer and branch tag included. Every miss degrades one step: an older binary or unreachable store falls back to the deterministic reminder to call `mcp__agmem__context` first, and no binary on PATH says memory is offline. After a compaction (`source: "compact"`) it also warns that context was truncated and remembered line numbers are unreliable |
| `PreToolUse` | `rtk hook claude` — transparently rewrites Bash commands so their output arrives compressed; plus the bare-worktree guard that denies raw `git worktree add/remove/move` in a bare layout |
| `PostToolUse` | two nudges, each fired at most once per session and neither able to block: after a successful `git push`, that a checkpoint seam has arrived; and when a Bash call reached for `sed`/`python` where nu is the house tool. The second exists because a rule in an always-loaded file is a rule you stop seeing — this repo`s own transcripts showed CLAUDE.md losing to habit on 18% of Bash calls |

### Where the rules live

`CLAUDE.md` is injected as a user message *after* the system prompt; an output
style is appended *to* it. So the two split by how much they need to survive
momentum, not by topic:

| File | Holds |
|---|---|
| `output-styles/ctx-flow.md` | the ~25 lines that must not be forgotten mid-task — routing, tool choice, answer shape |
| `CLAUDE.md` | the reasoning behind them, the tables, and every case they do not cover |

The cost is duplication: change a rule in one and it drifts from the other.
Keep the style terse enough that it is obviously a summary. Set via the
`outputStyle` field in `settings.json`; it is read once, so it takes effect
after `/clear` or a new session, and it does not reach subagents.

## Scoping capability to agents

The main thread never loads what only one role needs — the same routing rule,
applied to configuration.

### MCP servers: agent-scoped by default

A globally registered MCP server loads its schema into *every* session, which
is exactly the cost this framework exists to avoid. When a server is genuinely
needed, declare it on the one agent that uses it — it starts only when that
agent runs, and the main session never sees a token of it:

```yaml
---
name: db-inspector
description: Answers questions against the staging database, returns verdicts
mcpServers:
  - postgres:
      type: stdio
      command: npx
      args: ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-postgres", "postgresql://localhost/staging"]
tools: Read, mcp__postgres__*
---
```

`mcpServers` takes inline definitions (same schema as `.mcp.json`; stdio and
http/sse both work) or the bare name of an already-registered global server.
Declaring the server does not grant its tools — list `mcp__<server>__*` (or
individual `mcp__<server>__<tool>` entries) in `tools:` as well. Two servers
stay global: `nu --mcp` (it is the shell, and every session wants the shell)
and `agmem` (it is the memory — the main thread writes it, and every shipped
agent declares read-only access to recall its own role's rules).

### Skills: who gets to see one

The levers, ordered from fully documented to verify-once:

- **Guarantee a subagent has a skill** — the agent-frontmatter `skills:` field
  preloads the full skill content when the agent starts, no discovery step.
  Plugin skills are referenced by bare name, same as local ones:

  ```yaml
  ---
  name: migrator
  description: Plans and applies database migrations
  skills:
    - db-migrations        # local or plugin-shipped, bare name either way
  ---
  ```

- **Keep the model from invoking a skill anywhere** — set
  `disable-model-invocation: true` in the skill's own frontmatter; only you
  can trigger it, via `/name`. This also removes it from the preload pool
  ("preloading draws from the same set of skills Claude can invoke"), so it
  cannot combine with the lever above.

- **Hide a local skill by config** — `skillOverrides` in `settings.json`;
  values `"off"`, `"name-only"`, `"user-invocable-only"`, `"on"`:

  ```json
  { "skillOverrides": { "db-migrations": "off" } }
  ```

  Explicitly does **not** cover plugin skills — "Plugin skills are not
  affected by `skillOverrides`. Manage those through `/plugin` instead."

- **Hidden in main + preloaded into one agent** — no *documented* combo, but
  two mechanically sound ones: preload is startup injection, not a Skill-tool
  call, and the documented preload exclusions are only
  `disable-model-invocation` skills and the bundled `/verify` — neither hiding
  mechanism below is on that list.

  | Skill origin | Hide in main via | Grant to the agent via |
  |---|---|---|
  | local | `skillOverrides: "off"` | `skills:` preload |
  | plugin | permissions deny rule `Skill(<name>)` | `skills:` preload |

  Caveats: a deny rule blocks *invocation* — the skill's description line may
  still occupy main-prompt tokens; and both rows rest on undocumented
  interactions, so verify once in a scratch session (spawn the agent, have it
  quote a marker line from the skill) and re-verify after Claude Code
  upgrades.

- **The zero-dependency fallback** — don't make it a skill. Only
  `.claude/skills/` is discovered, so keep the folder at
  `.claude/docs/skills/<name>/` (for a plugin skill: vendor the folder out of
  the plugin instead of installing it) and have the agent's definition or
  playbook `Read` the `SKILL.md` at startup. Nothing else ever sees it; it is
  the same move playbooks already make.

## Memory

Durable state lives in **agmem**, outside both the window and the repo. The
space derives from the repo's shared git dir — every branch and worktree of a
project reads one store, and the reserved `user` space follows you across
projects. This is the answer to "how do I keep context without keeping it in
context": you don't hold it, you *address* it. The store holds the claims; the
window is a working set.

The loop: the briefing arrives with the session (the `SessionStart` hook
injects `agmem context`'s block; call `mcp__agmem__context` yourself on a
topic shift, or when no block opened the session); `recall` before assuming;
`/checkpoint` at seams — decisions with reasons, corrected assumptions,
gotchas — with `recall` before every write so a correction lands as
`supersedes` rather than a contradiction. The old claim stays readable and
dated; only one is live. Three kinds carry the lifetime split the old
ledger/state files used to: `fact` (fades over weeks unless used), `lesson`
(fades over months), `instruction` (pinned into every briefing). Branch state
is a `fact` with `decay_class: fast` tagged `branch:<slug>` — it dies in days,
as branch state should, with no file to prune.

What agmem does **not** replace: `.claude/notes/` stays as the artifact
dropbox — subagents write long output there and return the path. Claims go in
the store; blobs go on disk.

## Playbooks — knowledge that accumulates

A role's project specifics live in the store as `lesson`s tagged
`role:<agent>`. Each shipped agent recalls its own tag before starting
(read-only wiring, declared per agent); nothing else loads them, so an unused
playbook costs nothing. Recalled rules **append** to the agent's definition
and never override it; on conflict the agent file wins.

The guards the file version needed are mostly the store's behaviour now:
near-duplicates are refused at write time, unused rules fade by decay instead
of accumulating, and `/agmem tidy` merges what still piles up. What remains
yours is the structural guard: **proposing is not committing**. Agents end
with `LEARNED: <claim> — <evidence>`, and `/checkpoint` applies the four
tests (durable, non-obvious, earned, actionable) before anything lands. The
agent proposing a rule is often the cheapest thing in the system, and rules
bind every future run — dropping proposals is the normal outcome. Scripts
never self-modify at all.

## Git, gitignore, and worktrees

Memory is no longer a git question: the store lives under your home directory,
not in the repo. What remains in `.claude/` is the framework itself plus
`notes/`, the scratch dropbox — gitignore `notes/` (artifacts are
machine-local). When you do write `.gitignore` rules for `.claude`, use
`.claude/*` (contents), never `.claude/` (directory) — git will not descend
into an excluded directory, so `!` negations under it would be silently dead.

Worktrees need nothing shared for memory's sake: agmem derives one space per
repo through the shared git dir, so even a raw worktree is not amnesiac. The
`.claude` symlink convention (`/bare-worktree` manages it) is about the
framework files and profiles, not memory.

## Staying ahead of compaction

No hook can call `/clear` — the harness owns session control flow. The loop:

1. `/checkpoint` at a natural seam (a `git push` triggers a nudge automatically).
2. `/clear`.
3. `SessionStart` points the fresh session at the store; its first
   `mcp__agmem__context` call brings the briefing back.

Leave auto-compaction enabled as the backstop — disabling it trades a lossy
summary for a hard `prompt_too_long` failure. When it fires, the restart
warning says so, and memory is one `context` call away.

Prefer several short sessions chained through memory over one long one. A
600k-token session produces worse output than a 100k one even when it never
compacts; the token saving is a side effect of the quality win.
